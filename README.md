# Full-Stack Software Engineer

Hi, I'm Naseeba! I am a full-stack software engineer with a strong interest in data science. I am currently a senior studying computer science in Stony Brook University.
I love coding, but what drives me more than my love for writing code is my love for mentorship. I mentor women in technology while embracing learning as a mentee myself. Beyond tech, I own and lead Hands For Paws, a non-profit supporting dogs in Bangladesh. Let's connect and discuss tech, empowernment, and our canine friends!
