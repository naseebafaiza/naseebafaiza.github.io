# Full-Stack Software Engineer

Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Naseeba ('lucky' in Arabic) and I am originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I moved to Queens, New York before I started college on Long Island. I am a full-stack software engineer with a strong interest in data science and embedded systems. I am currently a senior studying computer science at Stony Brook University. I love coding, but what drives me more than my love for writing code is my love for mentorship. I mentor women in technology while embracing learning as a mentee myself. Beyond tech, I own and lead Hands For Paws, a non-profit supporting dogs in Bangladesh. Let's connect and discuss tech, empowerment, and our canine friends!
