# Hands For Paws Dhaka

## Background
### Founded in 2019
- I used to feed stray dogs with my friends on our way back from school. One day I thought to myself, "Why not make this a social media thing?" With the help of a great friend (my amazing co-founder), I was able to build a small community of animal lovers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Within a year, we realized we weren't the only ones with love for the strays. Slowly, a simple FaceBook page became a whole community. A couple of years in, we became a non-profit organizations! We made our own nutrition plan to feed the dogs and cats in our neighborhoods. We raised enough funds to keep operations going till the present. We have an amazing team of people with one goal - to lend a hand to a paw! Check out our FaceBook page.

## Current Work
### Internship Programs
- We have rotating internship programs throughout the year where we find new talent to handle our social media pages, communicate with our community to raise awareness, feed our precious dogs and cats, build shelter for our dogs and cats, and coordinate various events. Most of our talent consists of high school students and college students! Check out our Instagram page.
