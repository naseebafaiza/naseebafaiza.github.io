# About Naseeba

## Hobbies

### Vinyasa
- Throughout college I often failed to prioritize meditation and self care, but one summer in West Palm Beach, FL, changed it all. I discovered the practice of Vinyasa yoga! Outside of being an Engineer, I would love to get my certification and improve my Vinyasa practice.
